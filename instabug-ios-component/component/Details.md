Instabug SDK aims to save developers time. We believe that you should spend your time creating awesome features and improving your application instead of chasing information from your testers and users. We believe that spending hours and hours debugging to locate the source of a problem is a waste of time.

This can be done through our main products:
1. **Bug Reporting**
2. **Crash Reporting**
3. **In-App Chat**
4. **In-App Surveys**

With each crash or bug report sent from your application, we send all the information needed to help you debug the problem easily and communicate with the user reporting the problem. Here, we discuss all the information that you may attach to the reports.

1. **Identify User**
This section discusses how to bind each report to the identity of the user reporting the problem. You have the flexibility to add some extra attributes about the device as well as the user.
2. **Logging**
Instead of having to reproduce the crash or bug on your device to check the logs, we automatically attach the console logs, the verbose logs, all the steps done by the user until the report was sent, the user events as well as the network logs.
3. **View Hierarchy**
In case of UI bugs, you will find the view hierarchy of the screen content sent with each bug report.
4. **Attachments**
The SDK gives you the freedom to send different types of attachments with each bug report. You can add a screenshot from the app with the userâ€™s annotation, extra image from the gallery, audio recording, screen recording or an extra file that you create and attach yourself.
5. **Tags**
Last, to be able to categorize the reports on the dashboard and filter them you can add some relevant tags to the reports.
